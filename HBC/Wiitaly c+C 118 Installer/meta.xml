		<short_description>Install cIOS and Channel 118</short_description>
		<long_description>This is a mod of Dr.Clipper's IOS 236 Installer that installs a patched IOS36 in slot 118 and the Wiitaly 118Channel.
Small Explanation:
The original IOS36 cIOS118 is installed in slot 118. So where's the real innovation?
Simple: in the channel that ships with this app!
Yes, this application also installs a channel capable of starting the boot.elf of the HackMii Installer, allowing you to restore your softmod lost due to a Nintendo official update.

Credits go to Dr.Clipper and to the Wiitaly Team (Step, wasabi, student, Shur'tugal, Zahir71, and dafunk Lupo96).
